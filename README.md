Hide Jetpack Modules

This is just a quick little plugin useful for hiding Jetpack modules in the admin menu. Say you don't want your users to activate the Jetpack Comments module. Add it to $this->modules_to_hide and it'll be deactivated and have CSS added to the admin head that'll hide the tile from the Jetpack admin page.

This isn't as good as actual deactivation, a feature requested in http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1876
